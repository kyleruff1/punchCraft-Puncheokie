/**
 * The Voice Coach's audio implementation (M34-04, doc §18, §25).
 *
 * Implements `VoiceOutputPort` over `expo-audio` (cached clips) and
 * `expo-speech` (descriptive text only).
 *
 * ## This is the layer that owns timers, and only this layer
 *
 * D3 puts the cue clock in charge: the announcer computes deadlines and never
 * schedules. Honouring those deadlines is a transport problem, and it lives
 * here. `playAsset(id, atMs)` holds the clip until `atMs` and then plays it.
 *
 * **A deadline already past is played late, never dropped.** A punch command
 * that arrives 20 ms behind is still the punch the athlete is being asked
 * for; silence would be a worse answer than lateness. Only an explicit
 * `cancel` removes something.
 *
 * ## Preloading is mandatory, not an optimisation
 *
 * M34-01 measured 34.4 ms of jitter for a preloaded clip against 63.1 ms cold,
 * and ~24 ms more median latency. `preload()` runs during the countdown so no
 * clip is ever played cold mid-round.
 *
 * ## No-audio mode is a first-class state
 *
 * If the audio stack fails to initialise, `available` goes false, every call
 * becomes a no-op, and exactly one warning is logged. The workout stays fully
 * usable on visuals and haptics (doc §25) — a coach that cannot speak must
 * not be a workout that cannot run.
